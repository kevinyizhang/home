My name is Kevin Yi Zhang, and I am a first-year PhD student in the [Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders](https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-sciences-and-disorders/) at Northwestern University. My research focuses on the underlying principles that guide human auditory perceptual learning and how the mechanisms manifest in speech perception and speech-language disorders. I am interested in how the structure and schedule of a training regimen can affect the mental representation of learning. Additionally, I am interested in the clinical applications of my research in the assessment and treatment of speech-language disorders.

Before coming to Northwestern, I obtained my two master's degrees in Linguistics and Language Acquisition from the University of Kansas and Syracuse University respectively.
